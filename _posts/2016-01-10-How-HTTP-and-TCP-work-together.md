[TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) is a transport protocol that describes how a server and a client exchange data.

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is a request-response protocol that specifically describes how web servers exchange data with HTTP clients or web browsers. HTTP commonly uses TCP as its transport protocol. In essence, an HTTP server is a TCP server that "speaks" HTTP.
