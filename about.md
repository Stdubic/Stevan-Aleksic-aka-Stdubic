As a software developer, the code I’m working in quickly becomes a virtual home. I live there. I may be adding rooms and carpeting, or knocking out walls, or replacing cabinetry, or even just simply repainting, or hanging pictures, but I spend a lot of time there. An uncomfortable or crowded space — virtual or otherwise — is not a pleasant one to be in. I want my projects focused, and tidy. I want every line of code to be able to justify its existence, and work multiple jobs, too. I want the square footage to be as small as possible, without being cramped.

If a tiny house will do, why mess with the increased maintenance and cost of a mansion?

I use the right tools for the job, not merely those at my disposal. If I am not familiar with the right tools, language or platform - I’ll learn it. As well as being my career, this is also my passion. Learning and honing my skills is a full time job, and as such I utilise as much of my spare time as I can, to further my knowledge and abilities.
