As a software developer, the code I’m working in quickly becomes a virtual home. I live there. I may be adding rooms and carpeting, or knocking out walls, or replacing cabinetry, or even just simply repainting, or hanging pictures, but I spend a lot of time there. An uncomfortable or crowded space — virtual or otherwise — is not a pleasant one to be in. I want my projects focused, and tidy. I want every line of code to be able to justify its existence, and work multiple jobs, too. I want the square footage to be as small as possible, without being cramped.

If a tiny house will do, why mess with the increased maintenance and cost of a mansion?
